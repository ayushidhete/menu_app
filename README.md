# menu_app

A simple and efficient **Food Ordering Platform for waiters** to take customer orders at restaurants.  
This app helps streamline the order-taking process by allowing waiters to quickly select menu items, manage orders, and send them for preparation.

---

## Overview
`menu_app` is built to **digitize the restaurant ordering process**. Instead of using pen and paper, waiters can directly use this app to:
- Browse the restaurant's digital menu  
- Take orders from customers at the table  
- Update or modify orders  
- Send the order for preparation

This reduces mistakes, saves time, and improves efficiency in busy restaurants.
